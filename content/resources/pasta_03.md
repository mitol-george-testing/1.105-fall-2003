description: The objectives of this experiment are to determine the failure strain
  of a strand of spaghetti and test the validity of Euler?s theory for the large deflections
  of an elastic lamina. The educational objectives are to introduce the concept of
  uncertainty in measurement and to learn something about strain in bending.
