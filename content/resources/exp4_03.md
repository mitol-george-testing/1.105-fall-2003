description: Students will load a truss structure vertically at various pairs of joints
  (symmetrically disposed with respect to the length) and measure the vertical displacements
  of two or three joints. The objective is to compare the results obtained from analyses
  which model the structure as a truss (i.e., with friction-less pinned joints), with
  experiment.
