description: The objective is to verify the predictions of engineering beam theory
  in so far as that theory defines the centerline deflection and extreme values of
  the normal stress. Students will determine the relative stiffness of two aluminum
  beam test specimens of equal cross sectional area but different cross-sectional
  shape and see how they conform to theory.
